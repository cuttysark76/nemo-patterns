Package groups for different Nemo Mobile repositories.

NOTES:
* if multiple .yaml files are present in one dir VERSION file 
  is used to determine the version of the pattern.
* Each time pattern is changed the version of the pattern
  should be increased.

After updating the patterns you can create the tarballs with
./create-packages.sh command.

After the command new tarballs are located in packages/ directory.
Those tarballs should be then pushed to the OBS project where
that specific pattern is located.

Example:

./create-packages.sh

osc branch CE:Apps pattern-apps
osc co home:USER:branches:CE:Apps
cd home:USER:branches:CE:Apps/pattern-apps
cp ../../packages/pattern-X-###.tar.bz2 .

rm package-X-OLD.tar.bz2
osc ar
# Change version
vim *.yaml 
specify
# Add changelog entry about the changes made
vim *.changes 

osc ci -m "Updated patterns."

# Submit changes
osc sr
