Package groups for different Nemo Mobile repositories.

NOTES:
* if multiple .yaml files are present in one dir VERSION file 
  is used to determine the version of the pattern.
* Each time pattern is changed the version of the pattern
  should be increased.

After updating the patterns you can create the tarballs with
./create-packages.sh command.

After the command new tarballs are located in packages/ directory.
Those tarballs should be then pushed to the OBS project where
that specific pattern is located.

Example:

# Do the changes you want and remember to increment
# the version number in .yaml and if present VERSION files
vim patterns/apps/nemo-apps.yaml

# After changes are done create packages
./create-packages.sh

# Then branch from the project we are aiming at.
osc branch CE:Apps pattern-apps
osc co home:USER:branches:CE:Apps
cd home:USER:branches:CE:Apps/pattern-apps

# Remove old tarball
rm pattern-*.tar.bz2

# Copy the new package..
cp ../../packages/pattern-X-###.tar.bz2 .

osc ar

# Change version to match the new tarball
vim *.yaml
specify

# Add changelog entry about the changes made
vim *.changes 

# Push changes to your own project..
osc ci -m "Updated patterns."
# .. and submit them forward.
osc sr
